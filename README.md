# An-Interpolation-based-Synthetic-Battery-Data-Generation-Technique

## Get started
This project has been executed via google colab.

#### Steps To Follow:

1. The datasets used for this project can be downloaded from github as a zip file.

2. Extract the `datasets` folder from the downloaded zipfile.

3. Upload the extracted folder to google drive. Any new dataset to be used should be uploaded to this `datasets` folder.

4. The code to be executed in google colab:  [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SiW_YmNu6b5hyY-3vK3mXytN03BOXd5O#scrollTo=NxXLEHHUFgfU)

5. Make sure to set the runtime to GPU before running the code in order to ensure faster execution.

6. Make the necessary changes mentioned in the code to get the result.
